VELM Evolution — GEA-EGGROLL Integration

Group-Evolving Agents adapted for weight-level evolution of VELM populations.

Bridges two frameworks:
  - EGGROLL: maintains population of weight perturbations, evaluates fitness
  - GEA: enables experience sharing across population members

Evolution cycle:
  1. EGGROLL evaluates population on diverse task distribution
  2. Collect evolutionary traces per member
  3. GEA reflection: analyze traces across the group
  4. GEA evolution: bias next-generation perturbations
  5. Select parent group for next iteration

Selection criterion:
  score(i) = α_i × √nov(i)
