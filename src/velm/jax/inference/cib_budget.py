VELM Inference — CIB Budget Controller

Adaptive reasoning token budget based on Conditional Information Bottleneck.

Core idea: treat chain-of-thought as a compression problem. Monitor the
information gain per reasoning chunk and terminate early when marginal
gain drops below a threshold.

In VELM, each reasoning step generates K=4 tokens (one chunk), so budget
control is K× more impactful than in standard token-level models.

Two modes:
  - Static: fixed budget based on estimated problem difficulty
  - Dynamic: monitor info gain per step, terminate when diminishing
