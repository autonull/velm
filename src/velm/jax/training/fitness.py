VELM Training — Multi-objective Fitness Function

Combines quality and compression objectives for EGGROLL training:

  fitness(θ) = quality_score(θ) - λ × compression_penalty(θ)

Components:
  - quality_score: negative energy loss on next-vector prediction
  - compression_penalty: CIB-inspired penalty for verbose reasoning

The fitness is a black-box scalar — no differentiability required.
