# VELM: Vector-Evolution Language Model

## A Self-Evolving, Continuous-Latent, Gradient-Free Language Model Architecture

**Status:** Research Design Phase

### Abstract

VELM proposes a composite language model architecture that integrates six recent
advances into a unified system: continuous next-vector prediction (CALM), deep
nonlinear associative memory (Miras), gradient-free evolution strategies at scale
(EGGROLL), query-only test-time training for long context (qTTT), reasoning
compression via conditional information bottleneck (CIB), and group-based
open-ended self-improvement (GEA).

The key insight is that these innovations are not merely additive — they unlock
capabilities impossible under any single paradigm:

- **Nonlinear RNNs become trainable** because EGGROLL eliminates the need for
  backpropagation through time
- **Continuous-latent generation** becomes efficient because CALM compresses K
  tokens into single vectors, reducing autoregressive steps by Kx
- **Deep memory** over continuous vectors replaces shallow linear recurrence with
  MLP-based associative memory that can actually track state
- **Long-context failures** are fixed at inference time via query-only TTT,
  without retraining or growing the KV cache
- **Reasoning efficiency** is enforced structurally via CIB, compressing
  chain-of-thought by ~78% without accuracy loss
- **The entire system self-improves** through group evolution: populations of
  models share experience and evolve weights + workflows without human intervention

### Getting Started

This project is in the research design phase. See:
- `docs/architecture.md` for the full technical specification
- `docs/paper_outline.md` for the paper structure
- `docs/synergies.md` for how the six papers compose

### Preliminary Results & Real-World Implications

Based on proxy benchmarking against Vanilla Transformers (e.g., `src/benchmark_lm.py` on synthetic tasks and Tiny Shakespeare):

- **Massive Throughput Gains:** Because VELM compresses K-token chunks into continuous vectors (via CALM encoding) and evaluates them sequentially with Miras, its throughput (tokens/second) is significantly higher than equivalent-parameter Vanilla Transformers. This demonstrates strong edge computing viability where processing bandwidth is highly constrained.
- **Improved Retention tracking:** The introduction of Miras Memory with dynamic retention gating enables deeper MLP-based associative state tracking, balancing the intake of new information against prior states.
- **EGGROLL Trainability:** The project includes automated hyperparameter sweeps for EGGROLL tuning. While ES/CMA approaches naturally trade off direct accuracy improvement speeds compared to backpropagation over short epochs, they function autonomously and enable natively backprop-free components to be trained.

*(Note: These findings are derived from simplified proxy benchmarks meant to study the scaling behaviour on modest compute, such as single GPU or CPU. They should be considered strictly preliminary.)*
